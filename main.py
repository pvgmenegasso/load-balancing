Blank Lines

Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.

Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank line.

Extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of related functions.
Blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of related one-liners 
(e.g. a set of dummy implementations).

Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections.

Python accepts the control-L (i.e. ^L) form feed character as whitespace; 
Many tools treat these characters as page separators, so you may use them 
to separate pages of related sections of your file. Note, some editors and
web-based code viewers may not recognize control-L as a form feed and will
show another glyph in its place.
